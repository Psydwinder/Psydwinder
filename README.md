## What I've worked on

Some of the projects I've really enjoyed working on are:

1. [**Web Mash Up Project**](https://github.com/fac26/CatsDogsOrMovies) - This project was assigned to get teams to think about and implement their previous **knowledge of fetching API's** and **presenting the data in an interesting manner**. For this project I was responsible for creating the main page that ties the other three pages together and the movies page that **allows the users to watch trailers for films so that they can make a more informed decision about what film to watch.** 

You can view the live page [**here**](https://fac26.github.io/CatsDogsOrMovies/)

2. [**The Pig Game**](https://github.com/Psydwinder/Founders-6-The-Pig-Game) - This project was created as part of the application process for the Founders and Coders Bootcamp. The project gave me a chance to learn how to code a basic risk reward style dice game, using my knowledge of **ternary operators** and **reinforcing my knowledge of Event listeners** to perform **various functions.**

***Please note: The page is not responsive. For best results it is best played on a computer screen**

## What I'm working on

I'm currently working in a team of two to create a **To-do list APP** that implements our knowledge of **Test Driven Development**
